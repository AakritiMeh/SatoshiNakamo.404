            Bonded labor is a pervasive problem in the Indian brick industry, where workers are forced to work in inhumane conditions with little or no pay, and are unable to leave due to their indebtedness to their employers. This problem affects a significant number of people, particularly those from marginalized communities, and violates their basic human rights. The problem of bonded labor in the Indian brick industry has been widely recognized by human rights organizations, but effective solutions to eradicate this practice have yet to be implemented. Therefore, there is a pressing need to address this issue and develop strategies to end bonded labor in the Indian brick industry.

            "We realised a lot of these issues and problems arise from the system of wages that exist in the brick kiln industry.In piece system only the bricks count And not the human beings Workers are paid per 1000 bricks that they mount it does not matter how many hands or how many hours go into making those one thousand bricks and  because of  this women are invisible theyâ€™re never paid children are forced to work. child labour is incentivized if you don't put children to work then you can't complete the kind of production required to earn the minimum wage."
