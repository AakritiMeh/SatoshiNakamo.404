            we recognize that whilst the Indian
            economy has grown and developed the
            benefits of this growth hasn't trickled
            down to the people at the bottom; the
            workers in the brick kilns  are in severe
            debt bondage and their children are in child labour.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            inclusive of transparency of cash flow in the brick industry and the problem of bondage labour. <br>  <br>
            Thereby inorder to counter all these above problems we have come up with the cash flow management system integrated on blockchian-this includes making all the transactions taking place right from purchase of raw materials to final distribution of products.this also includes the payment of the laboursâ€¦..thus the labour payments when made transparent makes it easier to tackle the problem. <br> <br>
            This also removes the need of middlemen as there is only one wallet through which all the payments are being made,thereby easy to track  the amounts being sent <br> <br>

            Secondly, since Indian brick industry is 2nd largest producer in world but very unorganized. Connecting all the brick kilns sectors via blockchain would be a great help.
